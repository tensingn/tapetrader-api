# tapetrader-api
REST API for tape trader project

### Where to start
1. View docs.pdf for description and better understanding of API routes. (NOTE: The login and registration URLs in the docs are no longer in use. See Step 2 for correct URLs.)
2. Visit https://tape-trader-311601.uc.r.appspot.com/login to login or visit https://tape-trader-311601.uc.r.appspot.com/login/registration to register a user. (NOTE: These are the only two URLs that have a UI)
 
   - Take note of the id_token upon login. This will be needed if you wish to perform any CRUD actions on merch items. 
   - You can use username test1@test.com with password test123! if you do not wish to register your own email.

3. Inside the postman folder there are two files: a Postman collection and a Postman environment. Theses can be imported in Postman to thoroughly test the API.
